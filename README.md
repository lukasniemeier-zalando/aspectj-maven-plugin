# aspectj-maven-plugin
A fork of the mojo project to test some new changes.

The original version of this project is located at: http://mojo.codehaus.org/aspectj-maven-plugin/ I created this fork because I have been requesting a feature for over 3 months and someone has provided a patch for that feature, but I can't seem to get any of the original developers to work on it, so I figured I would just fork it make the change and put an alternate plugin up in the maven repos that we could use to solve this problem.
