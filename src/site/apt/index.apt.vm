Mojo's AspectJ Maven Plugin

  This plugin  weaves AspectJ aspects into your classes using the AspectJ compiler ("ajc").
  Typically, aspects are used in one of two ways within your Maven reactors:

  * As part of a <Single Project>, implying aspects and code are defined within the same Maven project.
    This is the simplest approach to start out with; feel free to examine the
    "Examples: Single-project AspectJ use" to better understand single-project use.

  * As part of a <Multi-module Maven Reactor> where one/some project(s) contains aspects and other
    projects within the Maven reactor contain code using the aspects ("woven by the aspects").
    This is a more complex and powerful approach, best suited when several Maven projects should be woven
    by a common set of aspects. The "Examples: Multi-module AspectJ use" contains a basic walkthrough
    of this approach.

  The AspectJ Maven Plugin delegates most of its work to the AspectJ dependencies included within
  the plugin. (Refer to {{http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/}} for descriptions and documentation about
  AspectJ itself).
